                    <p class="quote">
                        What is a sports car? A car may be a sporting automobile without being a sports car.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text">A sports car, or sportscar, is a small, usually two-seater, two-door automobile
                        designed for spirited performance and
                        nimble handling. The term "sports car" was used in The Times, London in 1919. According to USA's
                        Merriam-Webster
                        dictionary, USA's first known use of the term was in 1928. Sports cars started to become popular
                        during the 1920s.</p>
                    <p class="text">Sports cars may be spartan or luxurious, but high maneuverability and light weight
                        are requisite. Sports cars are
                        usually aerodynamically shaped (since the 1950s), and have a low center of gravity compared to
                        standard models. Steering
                        and suspension are typically designed for precise control at high speeds. Traditionally sports
                        cars were open roadsters,
                        but closed coup√©s also started to become popular during the 1930s, and the distinction between a
                        sports car and a grand
                        tourer is not absolute.</p>

                    <h2 class="title">Seating Layout</h2>
                    <p class="quote">
                        Traditional sports cars were typically two-seat roadsters.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text">Although the first sports cars were derived from fast tourers, and early sporting
                        regulations often demanded four seats
                        (even three-seaters were often produced by coachbuilders), two seats became common from about
                        the mid-1920s. Modern
                        sports cars may also have small back seats that are often really only suitable for luggage or
                        small children; such a
                        configuration is referred to as a 2+2 (two full seats + two "occasional" seats).</p>
                    <p class="text">Over the years, some manufacturers of sports cars have sought to increase the
                        practicality of their vehicles by
                        increasing the seating room. One method is to place the driver's seat in the center of the car,
                        which allows two
                        full-sized passenger seats on each side and slightly behind the driver. The arrangement was
                        originally considered for
                        the Lamborghini Miura, but abandoned as impractical because of the difficulty for the driver to
                        enter/exit the vehicle.
                        McLaren used the design in their F1. </p>
